<p>From above, the city looks like a grid of little enclosures that sort people into communities. Almost like a country. All the more so in a city as large as New York. The New York boroughs are fascinating to look at, and it is hard to find another city with this much diversity and distinct character. In Queens, a community might be dominated by a single group, yet it is also a place where many pause or pass through. A quiet borough that is, at the same time, compelling and full of communities. From a birdâ€™s-eye view, what do those communities look like spread across Queens?</p>
