This morning, the same day, the same routine. Why can people live with this routine, repeating again and again, even that lady neighbor in the quirky house beside the parking area for many residents. Every morning she takes her child to school, opens the garage, and waits for the man who seems to be her husband so they can leave by car. Is she happy with that life? Maybe something that simple really is their goal. Who are we to question it. Wake up, work, go home. What if it turns out we are forced to do that. Is it worth it to struggle to survive without any sense of fulfillment. Or maybe the more we get used to it, the more we are fine with all of this. Are we trained to live monotonously. Again, a man opens his shop every morning and throws the trash behind his store. Maybe meaning hides in the repetitions we resist. Maybe attention is the only freedom we can claim in a schedule that feels prewritten. I watch the street breathe and decide to count small mercies, like warm coffee and a seat on the train. If nothing else changes, I can still change the way I arrive to it. And for today, that is enough to keep walking.
