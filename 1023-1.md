School is an interesting place. It trains children to be disciplined. Early in the morning everyone goes to school. As we grow older, those little memories fade. The feelings that surfaced when the school bus came to pick us up. Seeing friends, walking home either happy or stressed because of exams. As we became teenagers, we were even glad to have grown up and to be graduating from all this soon. Looking back, is it not a blessing to be small and to go to school?
