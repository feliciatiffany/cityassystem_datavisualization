When a city becomes more than a system with hierarchies or the output of data, life can feel more meaningful. A city is not only a stack of buildings, people, ecosystems, and transit links, but a gathering of stories from millions of main characters and points of view. Each day is a good day or a bad day for someone. It reminds us that what appears as data is, at times, someoneâ€™s life.

The weave of observed data and lived interaction opens a new way of seeing for anyone, and for me from my bedroom window. The mix and connectedness of things, from the state of the sidewalk, the neighbor across the window, the weather, the air, the intersubjectivity of the surroundings, down to something as simple as a bird alighting, can offer a fresh view of a place I see every day. It teaches the skill of seeing and seeing what is unseen.
