69th St—an otherwise neutral subway stop, though it’s been busy lately. Construction is underway, and I bet people hate it; it’s taking forever. Sometimes when I pass through this station, I run into a colleague who looks pretty worn out. I know why: 74th St station, before 69th or after, the hub where people transfer and where all the interactions happen. I can’t decide whether to be angry or stay calm; my days feel the same either way. I ride the same track, see the same view. My entertainment is the little scenes inside my car—sometimes interesting, funny, or even bleak. But there’s nothing I can do except keep moving according to my schedule.
