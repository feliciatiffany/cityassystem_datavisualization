A dark night, with no stars in the sky. A young woman walks out of her office, her face tired. It seems the day has worn her down, yet it turns out not to be so tiring after all, because a man is waiting for her at the door. Her smile can no longer be held back, and he brings a bouquet of flowers even though there is nothing special about the day. A long day wishes to be made longer to savor the moment. They head home slowly, no need for dinner or a party. For them, simply being together is special enough. The subway ride feels very short. The woman wonders why every day cannot be like this. The day ends with something simple, talking with her partner about the long hours and going home side by side. Yet the presence of someone on an ordinary day can be more meaningful than on a special one.
