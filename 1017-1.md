I might be nothing more than a bird. In this cold I search for the sun and its warm rays. Where is my family? In conditions like these it is hard enough to find them, especially in this messy, sprawling city. It was that trail platform, the one that looked inviting, whatever that place is actually called, where I am not supposed to linger. I am afraid some hunk of metal might slam into me, or a deranged human might attack for no reason. Still, I am grown now. There is no harm in stopping there with the others to seek warmth. Deep down I hope I will meet my family again, the ones more intent on surviving.
