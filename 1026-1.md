Moving south today, what must it feel like to be a cloud? The clouds seem so light and easy with their lives. I want to fly, to fly until I am dizzy. Yet it also sounds exhausting to keep drifting in and out. Always observing, never acting. It feels like I am no longer talking about clouds. Sometimes I am forced to be a spectator, and life simply has to go on.
