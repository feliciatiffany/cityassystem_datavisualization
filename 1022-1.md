The man was shouting in the street—at whom, no one could tell. His black hoodie radiated an uneasy aura. He was in a hurry. Across the road, the scene was just as chaotic: someone knocked, then pounded, even kicked a door, as if searching for someone who refused to come out. He paced back and forth, unsure whether this was the right house. A dog kept barking, stoking its owner’s anger as they yanked the leash again and again. Anyone passing by would think some dark energy was seeping into the air.
