That day, the storm was fierce. Who could have known that God might be angry with the earth? Angry at human behavior? Angry at what we’ve done to this planet. And what of the creatures who live here? People seethed at their fate, pouring their fury into routine. Loud honks on the street, people screaming, and everything on earth seemed to conjure bad weather. While perhaps, in truth, the weather was punishing us for our constant wrongdoing. And fate is the sentence.
