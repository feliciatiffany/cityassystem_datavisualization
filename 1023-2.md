Airplanes keep moving every day. Their presence makes the word home feel relative. Vehicles head in opposite directions, bringing someone home or taking them away. People say time is relative. In truth, home is relative too. Flying, driving, cycling, and walking give different meanings to each person. Perhaps for me flying is always tied to the idea of going home, while for someone else it may be an everyday routine.
