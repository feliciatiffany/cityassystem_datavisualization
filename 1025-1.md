This morning the sky is blue, the sun warm enough. Everyone begins to step outside to seek what warmth there is. People are exercising, dogs start to run, birds are chirping, and everything feels more alive. A beautiful morning that feels loving. Stepping out of the house, a dog is very eager, trotting up to greet whoever passes.
